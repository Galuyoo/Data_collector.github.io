# Data_collector.github.io

this website was made as a collecting data prototype.
Its goal is to collect data from sensors then give the ability to the observer to visualise this data and take actions.

As this is my first project, i may have not done everything perfectly, but i am willing to improve even if its not my main specialty. 
# for i am an EE student.

in this project i have used several programming tools and technologies as the following: 
  +Software part: Css, html, JavaScript, PHP, sql, mysql. (i started by using flask but changed to PHP thanks to a friend 'Abdellatif       Laghjaj: https://github.com/abdellatif-laghjaj')
  +Hardware part: Raspberry pi 3 and 4, Mqtt/broker, Raspbian(linux), python.

to get a general idea about what i did in this project i recommend watching the presentation i made using 'canva': https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_IZTCJdECWndojHsqMRh6DSrQIYUjuI8/view?usp=sharing
